My name is Luca Eugenio Belaunzarán Consejo and I'm a last year Aerospace Engineering student at the National Autonomous University of México (UNAM). I'm currently going through my degree's aeronautical exit module and I am trying to specialize in topics relating to aeroservoelasticity and morphic wings ahead of pursuing postgraduate studies abroad. Currently, my goal is to find an internship opportunity to learn about the industry and build some work experience. Despite my field of study, I believe that I'm proficient in broader engineering areas such as software, electronics and design. As such, I don't close myself from opportunities in related STEM fields. At the moment, I have all but finished my degree's coursework and I'm in the process of writing my bachelor thesis.

I was proudly born and raised in the Tlalpan borough in southern Mexico City. However, throughout the years I have had the opportunity to live overseas for extended periods of time. As a kid, I spent a six months living in Bristol and later on five years in Auckland where I studied my high school in full at Green Bay High School. This past year, I went on exchange to Kraków to study at the Akademia Górniczo-Hutnicza (AGH) for a semester. Living in multicultural societies in the UK and in New Zealand was a unique experience which opened my mind to different cultures and ways of living across the world. Most importantly, I was able to pick up the language quite well and last year I sat the IELTS where I obtained a diploma equivalent to the C2 level in the CEFR framework. Learning languages is something that I enjoy and in addition to english, I have a DELF diploma for B2 level french and I'm in the process of learning the beautiful polish language.
